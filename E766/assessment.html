					<p>Assessment is used to determine whether or not a learner has met the learning objectives. There are two types of assessment:</p>
					
					<div class="columns">
						<div class="column">
							<h4 class="title is-4 has-text-centered">Formative Assessment</h4>
							<p>
								Assessment undertaken during an instructional interaction in order to gauge learning and determine the effectiveness of teaching <a href="#booth">(Booth, 170)</a> <br> <br>
								Due to the online nature of this project, the majority of assessment will be formative. Students will be able to evaluate their understanding of the topic they just reviewed, determine if they have grasped the concepts presented, and whether or not they need to seek the help of a librarian.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="column">
							<h4 class="title is-4 has-text-centered">Summative Assessment</h4>
							<p>
								Assessment conducted at the conclusion of a learning interaction in order to gauge the achievement of learning targets and evaluate instructor performance <a href="#booth">(Booth, 171)</a> <br> <br>
								The project is not intended to be a comprehensive instructional object; instead, students will read and access the topics that best meet their information needs. Thus, summative assessment will not be part of this project. However, the connect activities provided will give students the additional support that summative assessment would provide by letting students “connect” their previous knowledge to what they just learned and hopefully fill any gaps.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<h4 class="title is-4 has-text-centered">Reasoning for Assessment</h4>
					<p>According to constructivist thinking, learning takes places when the learner constructs new ideas or concepts from their current knowledge. The self-assessment, the rhetorical questions, and any job aides provides are intended to foster critical thinking and encourage connections to other similar topics or to knowledge that students may already possess. In other words, the content provided through this resource is meant to, first, fulfill a student’s immediate information need, but also present a model of instruction that hopes to stimulate interest by giving students control over how they learn. </p>
					
					<h4 class="title is-4 has-text-centered">How Learners Will Engage with Assessment</h4>
					<p>Since this is a self-guided resource, students are in charge of how they approach the topics presented and in what order, and thus, self-assessment is the most appropriate way to provide feedback. After each absorb activity, students are able to take a quiz (do activity) that will give them feedback for each of the questions answered. Whether they answered correctly (green boxes below) or incorrectly (red boxes below), the feedback encourages students to think about their answers and the reasoning behind them, and presents other ideas and concepts they should be thinking about. In a similar manner, the connect activities are meant to continue that self-exploration by providing additional questions and related topics.</p>
