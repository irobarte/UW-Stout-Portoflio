				<p>An alignment chart is used to diagram instructional activities and assessment strategies. It also shows connections between objectives (what learners will be able to do), types of activities (what learners will be doing), and assessment (how the learners will be measured). Beyond the clear connections between the objectives, activities, and objectives, the alignment chart provides a map of the instruction plan and allows the designer to show how the instruction will happen, how learners will be assessed, and how the instructional objectives are met.</p>
